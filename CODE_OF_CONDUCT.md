# TECoding Official Code of Conduct
As part of TECoding you are enrolled in the activities we create as a community and we want them to be as open and welcoming for everyone as they can be. To make sure we fulfill our pledge with the community, we provide this document, to ensure we provide a friendly, open, inclusive, and comfortable experience to everyone.

We also provide our contact information in the case of a violation of this Code of Conduct at the [bottom of the page](#Enforcement).

## Our pledge
In the interest of creating a safe space for everyone, we as members, contributors, maintainers, and leaders pledge to make participation in our projects, events, activities, and community a safe experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our standards:

Examples of **what we expect** from every member, individual, or organization that wants or has any kind of relationship with our community are:

- Be empathetic and kind towards others
- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Respect differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the community rather than what is better for us as individuals.
- Accept responsibility for our mistakes and apologize to those affected by our actions.
- Have an open mind to learn, even from our mistakes.

Examples of **unacceptable** behavior are:

- Putting others down for any reason, being rude or condescending.
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any kind of communication that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Corrective Actions
Community leaders can and will temporarily or permanently take away the rights for posting, publishing, commenting, or other types of communication when the community platform used allows it, as well as temporarily or permanently expel an individual from the community if needed.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise, unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting TECoding Leading Committee at incidents@tecoding.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The leading team is obligated to maintain confidentiality about the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Community leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community's leadership.
